# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a free, open sourced version control system that tracks changes in files. The difference bettwen git and Github is that
git is installed locally on the system and Github is a web-based hosting service which internet access is required. Essentially, git is a software whereas
Github is more of a service. 

Researched answer: Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is used to
coordinate work among programmers and can be used to track changes in any set of files. The difference between git and Github
is that git must be installed on to a local device to collaborate whereas Github is a web-based hosting service which 
requires the internet. Git can be seen as a single computer whereas Github is seen as a network of multiple interconnected computers. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Equality operator, Relational operator, and logical operator.

Researched answer: 
Equality operator compares one value to other and decides if the values equate to the same thing. If they do equate to the same value,
a boolean value of true is returned or a boolean value of false will be returned if the values are not the same.

Relational operator looks for a relationship between two values using a >, <, >=, and <= signs. It returns a boolean value.

Logical operator is denoted by usage of and (&&) and or (||). The 'and' along with 'or' take two complete statements and chain them together.
The && operator states that both statements must be true for a return value to be true. If one of them is false, a false value will be 
returned. The || operator states that at least one of the statments must be true for a value of true to be returned.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The array's index is the position of the element in an array and the value is the content or actual value in the element of an array.

Researched answer: The index of a value in array is the value's location within the array. The value is the content of each element in the array.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and string are similar in which both of them are zero-index based. The differences are the string is a primitive data
which is immutable and arrays are mutable. While there are some built in methods that are applicable to both strings and arrays such as
.slice, .concat and .indexOf, there are some methods that are strictly used for strings and arrays respectively. 

Researched answer: The key difference between an array and a string is that an array is a data structure that holds
a collection of elements that can be same or different data types, while a string is a collection of characters. Strings 
are also a primitive data which they cannot be changed. An array is mutable by default. Both array and string are zero-index
based which the first character of a string and first element of an array is zero. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is a technique in which two programmers work together. In pair programming, there is a driver who is
responsible for writing out the code and the navigator is responsible for instructing the driver on what code to write out. 

Researched answer: Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together on programming tasks at one workstation.
The driver is the programmer who is sharing the screen and writing out the code. The navigator is the programmer who indicates on what code is being written and
decides the direction to go.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.

2. Jest: is a JavaScript testing framework designed to make sure after an input of a code, the output matches with the expected output.
It also enables you to write tests for your code quickly.

3. Objects: are a data type that has collections of key-value pairs. They are containers for named values called properties.

4. Method: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

5. Classes: are template for creating objects. They are like bundle of data that manipulate data, group data and
functionality together.
